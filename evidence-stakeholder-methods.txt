2. Assess each stakeholder's power to influence program success (High/Medium/Low)
3. Assess each stakeholder's interest/stake in program outcomes (High/Medium/Low)  
4. Develop targeted engagement strategies based on power/interest positioning

### Visual Analysis Tools
**Power/Interest Diagram:** Visual mapping of stakeholders on power (y-axis) vs interest (x-axis) grid
**Stakeholder Influence Network:** Relationship mapping showing formal and informal influence patterns
**Priority Engagement Matrix:** Action planning grid for stakeholder engagement priorities

## Data Collection Timeline
