## Expected Challenges

### Access Challenges
Busy practitioners may not have time for interviews during peak business hours. Solution: Offer flexible scheduling including early morning or evening calls.

### Response Rate Concerns
Low response rate due to time constraints. Solution: Cast wider net with 10+ initial contacts expecting 30-40% response rate.

### Quality Concerns
Practitioners may provide generic rather than specific insights. Solution: Use structured interview protocol with specific scenario-based questions.

### Time Constraints
Assignment due November 21 limits interview window. Solution: Prioritize quick scheduling over perfect timing, supplement with published case studies.

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Sources
If insufficient interviews: Leverage published case studies, industry reports, and professional forums/Reddit discussions from verified industry managers.

### Modified Approaches
If time too limited: Email questionnaire with structured questions for practitioners who cannot schedule calls.

### Minimum Viable Evidence
Minimum target: 2-3 quality interviews plus 3-4 detailed case studies to provide sufficient practitioner perspective.
