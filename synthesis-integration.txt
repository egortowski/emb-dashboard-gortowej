# AGGREGATE: Bayesian Evidence Synthesis

**Completion Date:** December 2, 2025  
**EBM Process Step:** AGGREGATE - Synthesize evidence from all four sources using Bayesian reasoning

## Hypothesis Under Investigation

**X → Y Relationship:** Implementation of comprehensive retention strategies (wage improvements, flexible scheduling, training programs) → Reduced employee turnover rates in retail/food service

**Target Outcome:** Reduce annual turnover from current 75-100% to 40-60% within 24 months

---

## Bayesian Evidence Synthesis

### 📊 Scientific Evidence Analysis

**Prior Probability:** 60%
- **Justification:** Moderate confidence based on general management principles that better HR practices should improve retention, but uncertainty about effect sizes and industry-specific challenges in retail/food service

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- 4 peer-reviewed studies with clear effect sizes (r = -0.44, β = 0.31, OR = 1.67, r = -0.38)
- High-quality journals (Journal of Applied Psychology, Human Resource Management Journal)
- Meta-analysis provides strong statistical foundation
- Industry-specific research includes food service context

**Likelihood Ratio:** 4.0:1 (Strong support)
- **Rationale:** Multiple studies consistently show moderate-to-strong effect sizes. Meta-analysis by Rubenstein et al. provides comprehensive evidence base. Food service-specific study (Ghiselli et al.) directly relevant to context.

**Posterior Probability:** 86%
- **Calculation:** Updated from 60% to 86% based on strong, consistent scientific evidence
- **Confidence Level:** High - scientific evidence strongly supports intervention effectiveness

### 👨‍💼 Practitioner Evidence Analysis

**Prior Probability:** 86% (starting from scientific posterior)

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- 3 expert interviews with HR leaders having 8-15 years experience
- 2 detailed case studies (Starbucks, Costco) showing successful implementation
- Consistent themes across practitioners regarding implementation approaches
- Strong credibility scores across Peterson Framework dimensions

**Likelihood Ratio:** 2.5:1 (Moderate-strong support)
- **Rationale:** Practitioners consistently validate scientific findings and provide implementation wisdom. Case studies demonstrate real-world success but acknowledge contextual challenges.

**Posterior Probability:** 93%
- **Calculation:** Strong practitioner validation of scientific evidence with added implementation confidence
- **Key Insight:** Evidence converges on multi-pronged approach being most effective

### 🏢 Organizational Evidence Analysis

**Prior Probability:** 93% (starting from combined scientific + practitioner posterior)

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- Comprehensive BLS JOLTS and OES data analysis
- Clear cost-benefit analysis showing 83-92% ROI across scenarios
- Conservative estimates using industry benchmarks
- High-quality government data sources with large sample sizes

**Likelihood Ratio:** 3.0:1 (Strong support)
- **Rationale:** Financial analysis demonstrates clear business case. BLS data confirms problem severity (68% annual turnover in food service vs 34% national average). ROI projections exceed organizational requirements.

**Posterior Probability:** 96%
- **Calculation:** Strong organizational evidence reinforces effectiveness while demonstrating financial feasibility
- **Key Finding:** Strong business case with payback period under 12 months

### 👥 Stakeholder Evidence Analysis

**Prior Probability:** 96% (starting from combined scientific + practitioner + organizational posterior)

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- Comprehensive stakeholder mapping with Power/Interest analysis
- 89% response rate (32/36 stakeholders)
- Strong support across all stakeholder groups
- Clear implementation preferences and resource commitments

**Likelihood Ratio:** 1.8:1 (Moderate support)
- **Rationale:** Strong stakeholder support validates feasibility but reveals some implementation concerns about timing and resource allocation. Lower likelihood ratio reflects implementation challenges rather than intervention effectiveness.

**Posterior Probability:** 97%
- **Calculation:** Slight increase based on stakeholder validation of implementation feasibility
- **Note:** Lower likelihood ratio due to implementation concerns, not intervention effectiveness doubts

## Integrated Evidence Synthesis

### Final Posterior Probability: 97%

**Evidence Convergence Analysis:**
- **Strong Convergence:** All four evidence types support the core hypothesis
- **Consistent Effect Sizes:** Scientific evidence shows moderate-to-strong effects (r = -0.38 to -0.44)
- **Implementation Validation:** Practitioners confirm multi-pronged approaches work best
- **Financial Viability:** Organizational analysis shows strong ROI (83-92%)
- **Stakeholder Support:** High buy-in across all key stakeholder groups

### Evidence Quality Assessment

**Strongest Evidence Sources:**
1. **Scientific Evidence** - Meta-analysis with industry-specific studies provides robust foundation
2. **Organizational Evidence** - Comprehensive financial analysis with government data validation
3. **Practitioner Evidence** - Consistent themes across experts with successful case studies
4. **Stakeholder Evidence** - High response rates with clear support patterns

**Evidence Limitations:**
- Scientific studies vary in sample size and industry specificity
- Practitioner evidence limited to successful cases (survivorship bias)
- Organizational projections based on estimates rather than controlled trials
- Stakeholder evidence collected at one time point (preferences may change)

### Key Insights from Evidence Integration

**1. Multi-Pronged Approach Essential**
All evidence types converge on need for integrated intervention:
- Wage improvements (scientific: r = -0.44)
- Flexible scheduling (scientific: β = 0.31)
- Training programs (scientific: OR = 1.67)

**2. Industry Context Matters**
- Food service shows highest turnover rates (68% vs 34% national)
- Industry-specific research validates general findings
- Practitioners emphasize service industry implementation challenges

**3. Financial Case is Strong**
- Conservative ROI estimates exceed organizational thresholds
- Payback period under 12 months across all scenarios
- Cost per replacement ($3,200) justifies intervention investment

**4. Implementation Success Requires Stakeholder Alignment**
- High stakeholder support reduces implementation risk
- Clear resource commitments from leadership
- Employee preferences align with intervention components

### Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence in X→Y Hypothesis: 97%**

**Reasoning:**
- Convergent evidence across all four source types
- Strong effect sizes in scientific literature
- Successful real-world implementation examples
- Clear financial justification
- Strong stakeholder support for implementation

**Remaining Uncertainties:**
- Specific effect size in our exact organizational context (5% probability of lower-than-expected effects)
- Implementation fidelity challenges (3% probability of execution difficulties)

## Evidence Synthesis Summary

**Bayesian Journey:** 60% → 86% → 93% → 96% → 97%

The evidence synthesis strongly supports implementing comprehensive retention strategies. Each evidence type contributed unique value:
- Scientific evidence established theoretical foundation and effect sizes
- Practitioner evidence provided implementation wisdom and validation
- Organizational evidence demonstrated financial viability
- Stakeholder evidence confirmed implementation feasibility

**Ready for Application:** The 97% confidence level provides strong foundation for developing specific recommendations and implementation plans.

**Next Steps:** Proceed to APPLY phase with high confidence in intervention effectiveness and clear understanding of implementation requirements.

## Synthesis Conclusion

**Final Recommendation:** PROCEED with comprehensive retention strategy implementation

**Confidence Level:** 97% probability of effectiveness

**Implementation Readiness:**
- ✅ Strong scientific evidence base with effect sizes confirmed
- ✅ Successful practitioner implementations documented
- ✅ Financial viability confirmed with compelling ROI
- ✅ High stakeholder support and resource commitment

**Evidence-Based Action Items:**
1. Implement wage improvements (8-12% increases) as high-priority intervention
2. Deploy flexible scheduling system (primary satisfaction driver)
3. Develop career development pathways (long-term retention factor)
4. Establish recognition programs (engagement multiplier)
5. Monitor mediating variables (satisfaction, engagement, commitment)
