## Data Collection Plan

### Quantitative Data Collection
#### Metrics to Collect

**Problem-Related Metrics:**
- Annual Turnover Rate: 73% (industry average from BLS data) - Data source: Existing BLS JOLTS analysis
- Monthly Separation Rate: 6.2% (food service), 4.8% (retail) - Data source: BLS JOLTS monthly reports  
- Cost per Replacement: $3,200 average - Data source: Industry benchmarking and internal cost analysis

**Solution-Related Metrics:**

- Market Wage Premium Required: $2-3/hour for competitive advantage - Data source: OES comparative analysis
- Training Cost per Employee: $1,200 average - Data source: Internal HR cost tracking

#### Time Period Analysis
- **Historical Data Range:** 2019-2024 (pre-COVID baseline through current recovery)
- **Trend Analysis Period:** 24-month rolling analysis to identify sustainable patterns
- **Seasonal Considerations:** Holiday hiring spikes, summer employment fluctuations, back-to-school impacts
- **Baseline Period:** [What period represents "normal" operations?]

### Qualitative Data Collection
#### Internal Documents Review
- **Policy Documents:** [Relevant policies and procedures]
- **Meeting Minutes:** [Records of relevant discussions]
- **Communication Records:** [Emails, memos, announcements]
### Qualitative Data Collection
#### Internal Interviews
- **Target Interviewees:** Current employees, managers, HR personnel, recent departures (if accessible)

- **Communication Patterns:** How information flows between management and staff
- **Cultural Observations:** Workplace atmosphere, employee engagement levels, morale indicators

## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** HR manager (employee data), Finance manager (cost data), Operations manager (productivity data)
- **Approval Process:** Management approval for employee surveys and interview access
- **Privacy Considerations:** Anonymize individual employee data, aggregate reporting only
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Internal use only, no external sharing of sensitive data

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** HR Manager
   - **Data Sources:** Employee records, turnover data, exit interview summaries
   - **Approach:** Formal request through supervisor with academic research purpose explanation

2. **Secondary Contact:** Finance Manager
   - **Data Sources:** Cost per hire, training expenses, wage benchmarking data
   - **Approach:** Business case presentation showing potential cost savings from reduced turnover

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** All individual responses anonymized, aggregate reporting only
- **Data Security:** Secure storage on password-protected systems, limited access
- **Use Limitations:** Data used only for academic analysis and internal recommendations
- **Reporting Boundaries:** No individual identification, no proprietary cost data in external reports

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
- **2019 Performance Metrics:** Pre-COVID baseline for turnover rates, costs, and operational efficiency
- **Stable Operating Period:** 2022-2023 post-recovery baseline for current normal operating conditions

#### Normal Operating Ranges
- **Acceptable Turnover Range:** 30-50% annual (aspirational based on industry best practices)
- **Cost per Hire Range:** $1,500-2,500 (target improvement from current $3,200)
- **Time to Fill Range:** 2-4 weeks (current performance measurement)

#### Benchmark Comparisons
- **Industry Standards:** BLS JOLTS data provides sector-specific benchmarking
- **Geographic Comparisons:** Virginia regional wage and turnover data for local context
- **Best Practice Examples:** Costco and Starbucks benchmarks for aspirational targets

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
- **Quantitative Confirmation:** Turnover rates 20%+ above industry median
- **Cost Impact Evidence:** Total replacement costs exceeding 15% of annual payroll
- **Operational Impact:** Service quality metrics correlated with staffing stability

#### Problem Severity Measurement

- Version control for updated reports and analyses
- Cross-reference with BLS data collection dates for consistency

### Analysis Documentation
**Comprehensive Analysis Records:**
- Step-by-step methodology for cost calculations and trend analysis
- Assumptions made in projections and ROI calculations
- Validation methods for data accuracy and completeness

### Quality Assurance
**Data Verification Protocol:**
- Cross-check internal data with industry benchmarks from BLS sources
- Validate calculations with finance manager for accuracy
- Confirm trends with multiple data sources where possible

### Version Control
**Data Management System:**
- Separate folders for raw data, analysis files, and final reports

- Master file with latest validated data and calculations

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
**Potential Limitations:**
- Limited historical data for small organizations
- Incomplete exit interview data or feedback systems
- Lack of detailed cost tracking for hiring and training processes

### Data Quality Issues
**Anticipated Problems:**
- Inconsistent data collection methods over time
- Seasonal variations affecting trend analysis
- Small sample sizes for some metrics

### Access Barriers
**Potential Obstacles:**
- Confidentiality concerns about sharing internal financial data
- Limited time availability from busy managers
- Sensitivity around employee data and privacy requirements

### Time Constraints
**Timeline Pressures:**
- Assignment due November 21 limits data collection window
- Year-end business priorities may limit manager availability
- Need to balance thoroughness with practical deadline requirements

## Contingency Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
- **Industry Association Reports:** If internal data unavailable, use published industry benchmarking
- **Public Company Data:** Publicly available financial reports from similar organizations
- **Government Data:** BLS and Census data for additional context and validation

### Modified Analysis Approach
- **Proxy Metrics:** Use available metrics to estimate unavailable data points
- **Comparative Analysis:** Focus on relative rather than absolute measurements
- **Scenario Planning:** Develop multiple scenarios based on different data assumptions

**Organizational Evidence Collection Strategy Finalized:** November 20, 2025
**Primary Focus:** Leveraging existing BLS JOLTS and OES analysis for baseline metrics
**Ready for Implementation**
