# Problem Definition: High Employee Turnover in Retail and Food Service

## X â†’ Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
Retail and food service chains experience annual turnover rates of 75-100%, significantly above the national average of 38%. Major chains like McDonald's, Walmart, and Target face continuous recruitment cycles costing $3,000-$8,000 per hourly employee replacement. This creates operational instability, inconsistent customer service, reduced productivity during training periods, and damaged employer brand reputation that compounds recruitment challenges.

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)
Achieve sustainable turnover rates of 40-60% through evidence-based retention strategies, increase average employee tenure from 6-12 months to 18-24 months, reduce recruitment frequency by 50%, and decrease total turnover costs by 35-45% within 24 months while maintaining operational standards and service quality.

## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
Hourly front-line employees in retail and food service industry operations (ie. cashiers, sales associates, food preparation staff, servers, and shift supervisors).

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Comprehensive retention strategy including onboarding programs, competitive compensation, flexible scheduling, clear career development pathways, peer recognition systems, manager training on employee engagement

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Current industry standard practices: minimal 1-2 day orientation, base wage compensation, strict scheduling, limited advancement opportunities, traditional management approaches.

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Primary: Reduce turnover from 75-100% to 40-60% within 24 months. Secondary: Decrease turnover-related costs by 35-45%.

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
Large retail chains and food service operations with corporate oversight, and set management structures in competitive labor markets across the United States.

## Clear Problem Statement
Excessive employee turnover rates (75-100% annually) in the retail and food service industry creating operational costs, service inconsistency, and competitive disadvantage.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
High turnover drains profitability through direct costs ($15+ billion annually industry-wide), reduces operational efficiency due to constant training cycles, damages brand reputation through inconsistent customer experiences, limits growth capacity due to staffing constraints, and creates competitive disadvantage against retention-focused competitors.

### Stakeholder Impact
**Employees:** Job insecurity, limited career development, workplace stress from constant team changes. **Customers:** Inconsistent service quality, longer wait times, reduced product knowledge from inexperienced staff. **Managers:** Increased workload, recruitment stress, performance pressure. **Shareholders:** Reduced profitability and operational efficiency impacting returns.

### Strategic Alignment
Employee retention directly supports core organizational objectives including customer satisfaction improvement, operational cost reduction, sustainable growth capacity, market share expansion through superior service delivery, and long-term competitive positioning through workforce stability and expertise development.
